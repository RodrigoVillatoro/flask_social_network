# flask_social_network

Social Network made with Flask (for learning purposes). Most of the code was taken from the book [Flask Web Development](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031116.do), by Miguel Grinberg (O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2014). 

The official code examples presented in the book (Flasky) are also available in GitHub, [here](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky.git).
